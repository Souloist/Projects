[**Coin Flip Simulation**](https://github.com/Souloist/Projects/blob/master/solutions/Coin_Flip_Simulation.py) - Write a program that simulates flipping a single coin however many times the user decides. The code should record the outcomes and count the number of tails and heads.

[**Quote Finder**](https://github.com/Souloist/Projects/blob/master/solutions/random_quote.py) - Create a script that will parse quotes from a webpage and return a random quote

**PDF Appender** - Create a program that will append one PDF with another

**Happy numbers** -A happy number is defined by the following process. Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Ask for user input for the first N happy numbers.
